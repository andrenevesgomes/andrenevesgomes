# Hi, I'm AndrÃ© Gomes ðŸ‘‹


I'm a **_(junior) FullStack_** developer 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **everything!** (SQL, C#, CSS, [WordPress](http://bit.ly/projeto-europeu), Design, [Social Media](http://bit.ly/linkedin-altyra), QA, you name it)
- ðŸŒ± I will learn _(for sure)_ Vue.Js, React, Git, Python (more advanced) ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything! "What software do you use?", "What do you enjoy to do?", "What's in your setup?" ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? You can [follow me](http://bit.ly/GitHub-Andre) here on GitHub, on [LinkedIn](http://bit.ly/LinkedIn-Andre) or, to see my _'incredible designs'_, on [Behance](http://bit.ly/Behance-Andre).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm not related with the renown football player (and european champion with ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹) [AndrÃ© Gomes](https://www.instagram.com/aftgomes21/)
